Caleb's intentions are villain-like. He wants to take Emily because he is an evil type of person. It is out of spite more than anything else. He doesn't like her romantically, he just likes to ruin people's day and take without asking.\

Caleb is the main antagonist of the story. He is evil and the villain of the story. Everything he does is selfish and for his own gain. He is the leader of his group and even betrays his own friends if it causes him to gain control. Currently, there is no softer side to him. He is a hard villain who wants emotional destruction. He does not care about Emily like James does; he simply wants to take her, then dump her like trash when he's done with her. James could be thought of as the hero of the story.\

Caleb is not sour over anything, he just wants control and to show his dominance. Taking someone innocent and ruining her, then dumping her as used goods is all he wants to do. He's done it before and doesn't want to stop. He likes to ruin people's lives via manipulation, lies, and abusing any power he has.
