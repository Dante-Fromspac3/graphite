Scene 0:

James: The final year of high school starts today, my last chance at a lot of things. 

James: I feel like the supposed best years of my life were wasted. 

James: I got good grades, and teachers are quick to heap me with praise and offers of college recommendation letters. Which is cool I guess, but I’ve never reached that one milestone, the right of passage for everyone on the cusp of adulthood: 

James: I never had a girlfriend.

James: I mean, there’s been a girl I’ve liked, since forever basically, but I've never had the guts to tell her. 

James: It never works out with friends, you either confess and ruin the friendship, or try to stay friends but slowly yet inevitably drift apart.

James: The way I see it, I’ve got a 50/50 chance, and since its the last year and I can just fuck off to a college across the country if it goes south, I’m making this my year. 

*Emily enters*

Emily: Oh! Good morning James!

James: (internal) Shit! It's Emily, when I said I would shoot my shot this year, I didn’t mean right this moment!

James (blushing): Morning Emily, what’s up?

Emily: Oh you know, same old, same old. 

Emily: Hey! Glad I caught you, were you planning on joining any clubs?

Branching paths:

1. Yeah...clubs...was just thinking about them, which are you in again?

2. What? No, the less time I spend in school the better

3. Yeah actually, I had one in mind.

If option 1.

Emily: You completely forgot about the festival didn’t you? *giggles* that is so you. 

Emily: Anyway, I'm on the student committee, we oversee all the club activities. We’re holding a club fair after school, you should drop by.

James:
a. Remind me, what’s this festival about?
b. Sounds like fun! You’ll be there right?
c. After school? Yeah...no...I have plans. Doing other stuff, that’s not in school.

If A:

Emily: You know that big field and empty lot behind the school? It used to be a community market. 

Emily: People would come to sell their art, vendors would sell food, there were musicians palying on weekends, and even a farmers market. 

James: Really? It just looks like an abandoned lot.

Emily: Well, yeah, now it is, but it wasn’t always. 

Emily: The city just got too expensive and people who’ve been here for generations got displaced, and the market kind of died out.

James: Yeah, I heard about that, Gentrification or something right?

Emily: (happy) Yes! That’s exactly it! And ever since the new train station got built, the city wants to let some tech companies build offices and luxury condos over the lot!

James: That's awful! ...Isn’t it?

Emily: It is! Because even more people will be displaced and this neighborhood will lose the last of its character and charm. 

Emily: The festival is our last chance to bring back a timeless tradition and cornerstone of our community! People used to come from across the city to the market for art, music, and food.

James: Sounds like a big deal.

Emily: It totally is! That’s why you’ll help out by joining a club, right?
