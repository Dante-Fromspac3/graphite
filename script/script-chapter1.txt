*bell rings*

James (internal): For the first day back from class, there sure is a lot of homework. This is ridiculous. Senior year is supposed to be a cakewalk…

If options 3 or B (all B’s lead here) chosen in chapter 0:

James (internal): Whatever, it's not due this week, so I have time. I guess I could check out that club fair Emily was talking about.


If options 2 or C (all C’s lead here) chosen:

James (internally): How lame...At least it's a nice day, I can head to the cafe and sit on the patio and finish reading manga.

*Celia enters, bumps into James, dropping something glass*

Celia: Mierda! That piece took me weeks!

James: Oh! Sorry…

Celia: (sighs) No, it was my fault, I was trying to carry too much. (another piece drops) Damn it!

James: Here, let me help you.

Celia: Really? Thanks! You're a Lifesaver!

James: Yeah, no problem. Where are you headed?

Celia: To the student commons! I have to set up for the club fair.

James: (internal) there goes my cafe and manga idea…

Celia: Are you in any clubs?

James: no, I never really-

Celia (interrupting, excited): What! You should totally join the art club then! We have soooo much fun, especially this year with the festival, a girl is making plaaaaans. I mean, when I say we, I just mean me, at the moment, but that's all about to change right?

James: I’m sure--
Celia (interrupting): Oh! Last year, we did that big mural on the side of the school, by the teachers parking lot? We got hella push back because admi wanted some boring ass picture of the mascot, but we were like “no, fuck that” this is a working class community with hella history and heritage right? So we wanted to put something that reflected that.

James: Yeah, I reme-

Celia: (interrupting) I wanted something a bit more avant garde, but we can’t win them all right? We were able to settle on a really cool design. We even made it onto an art zine.

James:(internal) Man, does this woman ever stop talking?

James: Wow, that's...impressive.

Celia (proud/smug): Mhmm. But everyone graduated last year, so that was kind of like our magnum opus. My hope is that we can recruit enough new members to go out on an even bigger bang this year! Oh, I'm a senior by the way, you?

James: Same. My name is James, in class 2-b.

Celia: (shocked) Ay Dios Mio! I forgot to introduce myself! I’m Celia, in class 3-a, a pleasure to meet you.

James: Nice to meet you too.

Celia: Oh! Looks like we’re here! Hey, so I gotta go set up, but drop by and sign up for the Art club ok?

James: Well, I wasn’t really planning on--

Celia (interrupting): Alright then, see you later!

*James gains some affection with Celia*

*Celia exits*

James (internal): Damn it...how did I wind up here after all?


If option 3c:
James: Whatever, parents are gonna be home for another hour or two, gives me plenty of time to go fire off some knuckle children.

Celia: That’s what I said right? Oh! Right my beaner must have come out, in spanish the J makes an H sound. 

James:
Actually, I like the way you say it.
Huh, today I learned….
Well, its an english name, so say it right

If option A:

Celia (sly): Oh do you now? Well then Jamie, if you like it so much, you’ll just have to join the Art club, won’t you?

James: You are quite the determined woman, aren’t you?

Celia: (laughs) How else is a girl to get what she wants?

*James gains some affection with Celia*

If option B:
Celia: Right? Everyday with me you learn something new, kinda makes you want to join the art club doesn’t it?

Story converges:

If option C:

Celia: (angry) Este gringo hijo de puta. How about you take your bigoted ass somewhere else? I don’t need this type of energy in my life.

James:
1c. Just saying, my name is James.
2c. You’re right, that came out wrong.

If 1c:

Celia: And I’m just saying fuck off.

James: Can I still join the club though?

Celia (annoyed):Like, the club might get shut down if I said no, so you can write your name down or whatever. But, you know, I can’t guarantee that paper won’t get lost or fall in the garbage, or get incinerated, or something like that.

*James loses lots of affection with Celia*

James: Hi.

Anna:...

James: uh….

Anna: ....Marvelous. Simply marvelous.

James: Excuse me?

Anna: (startled) Eek! How long have you been there?

James: Not too long, what are you watching?

Anna: Oh! Right, I just finished Promising Young Woman. I’m kinda on a female director binge at the moment.

James:
Oh yeah? What was it about?
I take it this is the film club then, right?
Good movies are good movies, SJW’s always wanna make things about race and gender.
If option 1:

Anna: It's great! It’s a dark comedy about a woman who wants to avenge her best friend who died after being sexually assaulted.

James: That..certainly is dark. And it's a comedy?

Anna: Mhmm. It shines a light on a lot of the violence perpetrated against women and the struggles we face under a patriarchal society. Its heavy subject matter, but pointing out the absurdity of these systems is oddly cathartic and hilarious.

*return to options*
*option 1 removed*

If option 2:

Anna: Oh! Right, sorry, yes. Yes! This is the film club...ummmm did you want to sign up?

James: If you could tell me a little about what you do in the club first…

Anna: oh...OH! Yeah, of course. Um, well...this is a film club and….we watch films, good films, indie films and international films mostly. Um...and...yeah...we talk about them...I’m sorry, I’m rambling…

James:
2a. No, you're fine.
2b. A little bit. How do you decide what movies to watch?
2c. You still didn’t answer the question.

If 2a:

Anna (embarrassed): Thanks...in truth, I only recently became de facto club president. No...that’s not exactly true, the club actually disbanded last year due to low attendance. I’m actually trying to restart it….

James: Oh cool, you must be really passionate about film.

Anna: Yeah, you could say that (nervous laughter) but to answer your first question, we generally meet up to watch a movie and discuss its themes, cinematography, writing, the acting, you, the various parts that make up a film. So, there’s always a little bit of something for everyone…

*James gains affection*

Story converges:

If 2b:

Anna: Oh...sorry...I tend to do that. Um...well so far I've just been catching up on my back catalogue, buuuut, if someone were to join, I’d be more than open to suggestions.

*James gains small amount of affection*

Story converges:

If 2c:

Anna: Oh...sorry...I tend to do that. Um, yeah, so we have discussions about the movies we watched, usually about thematic elements and cinematography...That sorta stuff…

James: Sounds interesting.

Anna: yeah….

*James loses affection with Anna*

Story converges:

If 3:

Anna:(nervous laughter)...wait, you’re serious?  Wow! I...really? Hmmm…
I don’t have the emotional capacity to engage you on this...bullshit right now, nor am I required to cure you of your ignorance, but I’ll try I guess.  
Here, go check out Intersectionality as Critical Social Theory by Patricia hill Collins, they have it in the library. 
Also read literally anything by Kimberle Crenshaw. If reading isn’t your thing, Contrapoints has some good videos on youtube, but they can run a little long. 
If you can only pay attention for 15 minutes or less, then look up Intersectionality, critical race theory, or feminist film theory on Ted talks. 

James: I thought this was a film club.

Anna:...Yeah, about that...I’m actually reconsidering running a club…so…

1d. There’s this prog metal band from Japan I found on bandcamp recently...


If 1a:

Joycelin: *sigh* a boring ass answer that’s rarely accurate, I bet I could list ten genres you have either no interest in or never heard of. You probably still listen to terrestrial radio.

James: Ouch. and what about you then?

Joycelin: Doom, Death, Depressive Black metal, Mid-west Emo and 90’s emo, Skramz, Progressive Metal, Technical Death Metal…

James: Jesus…

*James loses affection with Joycelin*

James:

2a: My bad, wasn’t trying to be offensive or anything.

James:

Ok boomer.
Is mayonnaise an instrument?
Nope, I’m good.

If a:
Joycelin: Call me a boomer all you fucking want. I’m not discrediting other genres and methods, it's just not what we do. Besides, the school only has second hand physical instruments, so we couldn’t do digital even if we wanted to.

*return to options*

4c. Are you gonna give me a spanking, or perhaps you’re the one who needs a paddlin’?

James: Pass.

Emily (pouting): Why? You’re actually pretty popular, you know, I'm sure people would love to join a club you started.

James: Most of the stuff I like to do are solo activities, and I'm not sure how you would form a club around it.

Emily: Yeah, not sure how you can make a group about pretending to read classical literature at a cafe while people watching.

James: Hey…
