    j "The final year of high school starts today, my last chance at a lot of\
    things. I feel like the best years of my life were wasted."

    j "I got good grades, teachers are quick to heap me with praise and offers\
    of college recommendation letters, which is cool I guess, but I’ve never\
    reached that one milestone, the right of passage for everyone on the cusp\
    of adulthood. I never had a girlfriend."

    j "I mean, there’s been a girl I’ve liked, since forever basically, but\
    I've never had the guts to tell her. It never works out with friends, you\
    either confess and ruin the friendship, or try to stay friends but slowly\
    yet inevitably drift apart."
