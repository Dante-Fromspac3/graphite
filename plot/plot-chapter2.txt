Chapter 2 plot:
Introduction to the chosen club and more background on the girl (or girls if emily is also in the club). A choice is given, how will the club showcase themselves at 
the festival? 
There are multiple points to gain more affection/love points and learn more about the girl.

Route A is if you encourage the Routes Romance partner to go with her own idea, or otherwise support an idea that aligns with her interests.

In routes that Emily is on, you can support Emily's decision over the club girl without going onto route B.

Route B is the bad ending. Choosing ideas that are against the club girls interests 
(for instance, doing something for a cash grab, doing something shallow but marketable, or just dismissing their idea as dumb or unworkable).

"spy" character is intorduced as a club member.

If student comittee route is chosen, Caleb is introduced as an antagonist here.
