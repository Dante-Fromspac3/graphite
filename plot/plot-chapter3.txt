Chapter 3 plot:

The club girl backstory and personality is introduced more in the intro of the chapter, including more backstory of the club. 

A chance to gain or lower affection/love points.

Caleb is a part of the student committee (he joins to fuck with james) and interferes with the club out of spite. This is done by either cutting the budget, 
or taking away the meeting room (garden club is exempt form this).

James has to offer to help the club (find an alternate space to operate from, or a fundraiser) or give in to Caleb’s bullshit. 

To save the club requires multiple questions/skill checks/branches, so there is a fail state.

During the student committee route, it is revealed that there is a budget shortage for all of the club, and that Caleb’s gang is starting a club, 
which will give the committee funds from their initial fees. Caleb's group is a front for nefarious activity. 

James will have to choose between cutting a club and allowing Caleb's gang to have a club.

If Caleb's gang gets to have a club, Caleb still cuts a club by taking away their meeting space, removing them from the festival and as a romance option.
